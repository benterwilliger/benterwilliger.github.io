	<P> <font face="comic sans ms"> So lets start out with the first meal of the day, breakfest! My favorite breakfest
	food would probably have to be chocolate pancakes. I mean c'mon who doesn't like some
	chocolate pancakes in the morning?! To go along with that I will most definitely have 
	some scrambled eggs and hash browns to go with it! To wrap everything up, (no pun intended)
	I will have either a tall glass of chocolate milk or OJ to go with it! </P> </font>
	
	<P>	<font face="comic sans ms"> Lunch on the other hand is tough. I debate lunch everyday in my mind because its
	all on how I feel at the moment ya know?? Anyways, the most delicious lunch I would 
	prefer everyday would be leftovers from the night before! Who wants to go through the
	whole process of cooking three times a day when you can just eat leftovers for lunch!
	That's the way I do it! Plus, its easy and quick to do! All you do is pop it in the 
	microwave! I'd more than likely have some fruit like grapes, pineapple, or watermelon
	to go with it along with a glass of V8 fruit juice! </P> </font>
	
	<P> <font face="comic sans ms">	Finally lets talk about dinner, my favorite meal of the day! My favorite dinner 
	would be grilled BBQ chicken with a side of couscous and corn to top it off! Of course
	my mom makes me have a salad with every dinner even tho they're disgusting because 
	they have spinach in them and it makes a funny sound on your teeth when you chew it!
	It makes my skin crawl like nails on a chalkboard! My drink of choice would be milk 
	once again but if I was at a restaurant I would get a shirley temple! </P> </font>

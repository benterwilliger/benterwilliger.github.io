	<P> <font face="comic sans ms"> I'm 18 years old and have been playing baseball for my entire life! I started when
	I was 4 years old and I've loved every minute of it! That was what brought me to the 
	University of Maine. Ever since I was a little kid, I always wanted to play college
	baseball and professional baseball. I'm so proud that I get to represent UMaine on
	and off of the field! I'm excited to be apart of the phenomenal baseball tradition 
	UMaine has and to continue adding to it! Alright enough about sports and onto my 
	family! </P> </font>
	
	 
	<P> <font face="comic sans ms"> I have one brother and he is 20 years old and attends Adelphi University, which is 
	about 20 minutes outside of Manhattan. He also plays baseball there! Both of my 
	parents are elementary teachers; my Dad is gym teacher and my Mom is an AIS 
	remedial reading and math teacher. Also we have an old pup, his name is Taggert and he
	just turned 12 years old! He's a rescue pup from Hurricane Katrina and he's the best
	dog in the world! Another notable thing is that my family built an apartment onto our
	house for my Grama because when my Grandpa died, she could afford to live by herself.
	It was the best move ever because now my Grama is one of the biggest parts of my life
	and it's awesome! She comes to all of our games and supports us which is the best
	because she always roots the loudest! She's in the middle of the picture below! </P> </font>

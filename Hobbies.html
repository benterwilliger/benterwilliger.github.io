	<P> <font face="comic sans ms"> I only have a couple hobbies because baseball takes up all of my time! My first 
	one is woodworking/painting. I have a great time re-doing projects and finishing them 
	up. Whether it be a painting a bench, building a deck, finishing a porch, etc. This is
	why whenever baseball ends, I want to become a house flipper like I mentioned before. 
	Another hobby of mine is landscaping and yard work. After you're done  and you step 
	back and look at what you achieved, is simply an awesome feeling. I feel satisfied 
	just by making things look nice whatever they may be! My final and last hobby is going
	to professional baseball games with my brother and Dad. I know it doesn't sound like a 
	hobby but I count it as one! So far we have been to 14 stadiums! Some of them aren't 
	even around any more which is even more cool! So out of the ones still around I've 
	been to 11 out of 30 of them! The most recent was Fenway Park which is pictured 
	above. This is a picture from my seats! </P> </font>
